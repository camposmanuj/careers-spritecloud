          <p>At spriteCloud, testing is in our blood. Our software testing and automation consultancy company was founded by three testers in 2009, with the idea of creating a company that is a great place to work at for testers. Fast forward to 2022, we are now a team of 60+ and growing, with our headquarters in Amsterdam and an office in Barcelona, but the initial idea is still there. </p>
          <p> No matter the size of spriteCloud, this sense of community that was so central to its creation should remain. This is not achieved by a top-down approach but by empowering our colleagues with the time, budget and flexibility to make spriteCloud the company they always wanted to work at.</p>

          <p>As such, we encourage our staff to ask what they can do for spriteCloud rather than what spriteCloud can do for them. We have a shared responsibility to make spriteCloud a great place to work.</p>
          
          <p>Our passion for testing and our commitment to high-quality work has allowed us to work with leading brands, both in the Netherlands and internationally, such as Heineken, Ahold and Adidas. For our staff, this means they get the incredible opportunity to develop their technical skills on interesting projects and build an impressive resum√© of work experience.</p></div>
